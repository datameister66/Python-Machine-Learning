# Python Machine Learning Repository
## A collection of machine learning projects and notebooks in Python (work in progress)
This repository replicates the work done in MML with R, 3rd Edition. The datasets are the same, but the code is undergoing continuous improvement and development
## Purpose
This repository is a sandbox for exploring machine learning concepts, implementing algorithms, and sharing practical examples. Expect ongoing updates as I refine the code, add new features, and incorporate feedback.

## Current Contents
- **Scripts**: Basic Python scripts for ML tasks (e.g., data preprocessing, model training).
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating ML workflows (more to be added soon!).
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the projects (if applicable).

## Work in Progress
This repository is actively evolving:
- New Jupyter notebooks will be added to showcase specific ML techniques.
- Existing code will undergo revisions for better performance, readability, and documentation.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome as I continue to build this out!

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/datameister66/python-machine-learning.git
